#Crystals Collector

##Overview:

Crystals Collector is a number guessing game that users can play in the browser. For each game session, a random number is generated and each of the four crystals also have random values to ensure users have a challenging experience for each session. The random number ranges from 19-120 and each crystal has a hidden value between 1-12.

A specific amount of points are added to the player's total score for each crystal and the player wins the game if the total score matches the random number. The player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number. The browser will also keep track of the amounts of wins and losses for each round.
